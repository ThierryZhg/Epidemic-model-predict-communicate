# In the Shoes of an Epidemiologist – Epidemics: Modeling, Forecasting, Communicating

## Overview
This project, part of an integration course in Mathematics and Data Science (28th November 2023, led by V. Letort & G. Faÿ), simulated a real-world scenario where participants acted as epidemiological experts at institutions like the Pasteur Institute.

## Context & Background
The international network of Pasteur Institutes (RIIP) aims to improve human health through biomedical research, public health initiatives, training, and technological transfer. Inspired by the 2013–2014 Ebola outbreak response, the project challenged teams to model and manage epidemic crises.

## Simulation Challenge
- **Scenario:** A West Nile Virus outbreak in Rennes (set in 2030).
- **Situation:**  
  - In April 2030, 500 Canada geese carrying West Nile Virus settle on the Saclay plateau.
  - The virus is transmitted by tiger mosquitoes; local birds serve as accidental hosts.
  - Affected populations include three campuses: HEC (5,400 persons), X (4,320 persons), and CS (5,700 persons) — with CS (Rennes) as the primary target (21,300 persons).
- **Objective:** Minimize hospitalizations and control the epidemic through strategic, timed interventions.

## Intervention Options
Interventions could be applied at key time points:
- **Day 1:**  
  - Manage 100 infected migratory goslings (fill, capture, or quarantine).
  - Distribute mosquito nets.
- **Day 20:**  
  - Control local birds (culling or quarantine).
  - Reduce mosquito populations via insecticides and larvicides.
  - Administer an experimental Phase 3 vaccine to eligible individuals.
  - Quarantine symptomatic individuals immediately.
  - Relocate up to 50% of non-infected persons.

**Budget:** €500k (with cost efficiency not being a primary evaluation criterion).

## Courses & Skills Applied
- **Courses:**  
  - Epidemiological Modeling  
  - Algorithmics and Complexity  
  - CIP-EDP  
  - Diffusion on Graphs  
  - Epidemiology  
- **Skills:**  
  - Discrete/continuous mathematical modeling  
  - Data analysis and forecasting  
  - Crisis communication  
  - Collaborative problem-solving and critical thinking

## Deliverables
- **Simulation Model:** A dynamic model predicting epidemic spread and evaluating intervention strategies.
- **Presentation:** A slide deck summarizing methodology, simulation outcomes, and strategic recommendations for public health decision-makers, the media, and the scientific community.

## Collaborators & Resources
